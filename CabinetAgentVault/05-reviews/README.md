# Reviews

This folder is for Vincent to read, decide, and mark done.
Nico drops review documents here. Vincent checks boxes and replies.

## Folders

- `projects/` — project status reviews, scope changes, go/no-go decisions
- `tasks/` — task list reviews, priority changes, backlog cleanup
- `decisions/` — choices that need Vincent's input before Nico proceeds
- `housekeeping/` — file cleanup, org changes, system maintenance (like vault consolidation)

## How it works

1. Nico creates a review doc and drops it here
2. Vincent opens it in Obsidian, reads, checks boxes
3. Nico picks up the decision and acts
