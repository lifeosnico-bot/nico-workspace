# Vincent's Feedback on Task Architecture Plan

_Raw feedback from Vincent on [[2026-02-23_task-architecture-plan]]._

1. "Hey Siri, remind me in Nico Inbox: [task]" — just make this *"Hey Siri, remind me"* no nico's inbox. We are only setting up 1 inbox and Siri has a hard time when there's too many words that can confuse her.
2. After making this Siri change, make sure all of the other associated changes are made also. There are a lot of items that are dependent upon this. There is also a line where I need to set this up on my phone. How will this work with this not being my main account — can we set it up to push to my main account? I think we both missed that super important part of the process while doing all our planning unless you accounted for it.
3. `00-dashboard/task-board.md` — the readable task view Vincent checks on M3: *what is this for?*
