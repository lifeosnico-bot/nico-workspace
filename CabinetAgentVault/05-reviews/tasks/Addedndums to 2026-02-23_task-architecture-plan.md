1. "Hey Siri, remind me in Nico Inbox: [task]"---just make this *"Hey Siri, remind me"* no nico's inbox. we are only setting up 1 inbox and siri has a hard time when theres to many words that can confuse her. 
2. After making this siri change, make sure all of th eother associated changes are made also. There are alot of items that are dependent upon this. There is also a line where i need to set this up on my phone. How will this work with this not being my main account can we set it up to push to my main account. I think we both missed that super important part of the process while doing all our planning unless you accounted for it
