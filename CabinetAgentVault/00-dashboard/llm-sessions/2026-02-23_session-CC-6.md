## Completed
- Built 50% context window alert using StatusLine mechanism (only way to access token count)
  - `~/Nico/Scripts/context-monitor.sh` — statusline script shows `ctx: XX%`, fires Telegram at 50%
  - Added to `~/.claude/settings.json` as statusLine config
  - Session-start.sh updated to clear alert sentinel each session
- Built permission prompt alert using Notification hook
  - `~/Nico/Scripts/permission-alert.sh` — fires Telegram when Claude Code needs approval
  - 2-minute cooldown prevents spam
  - Added to settings.json as Notification hook with permission_prompt matcher
- Both alerts tested and confirmed working

## Decisions
- StatusLine is the only mechanism with access to context window metrics (hooks don't get token counts)
- PreCompact hook exists but doesn't provide token data — statusline is the right approach

## Notes / Blockers
- Telegram bot token still needs rotation (P1 Vincent action — unchanged)
- On master branch (not feature branch) — should create branch for next session

## Next Session
- Top priority: Phase 0E metadata standards enforcement
- Vincent needs to: Telegram token rotation, Slack workspace, 1Password, Obsidian Phase 2
