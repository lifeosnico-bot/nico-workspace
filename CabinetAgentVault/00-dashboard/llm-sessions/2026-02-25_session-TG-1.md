## Completed
- Created Obsidian templates: video research, morning report, nighttime report, EOD wrap up.
- Created first processed video note for OpenClaw Discord multi-agent workflow.
- Added Daily Reports links + Vault Contract link to `00-dashboard/home.md`.
- Wrote and linked the Vault Contract; enforced Session Start Protocol in `CabinetAgentVault/CLAUDE.md`.
- Created Nico OS running list.
- Researched Glue (glue.ai + docs) and filed vendor note.
- Created Area folder for Chief of Staff.

## Decisions
- Telegram remains the 1:1 CEO Desk interface.
- Daily reporting system = Morning + Nighttime + EOD, stored in Obsidian and delivered in Telegram.
- Adopt Vault Contract as the shared artifact lane system for all agents.

## Notes / Blockers
- Comms platform decision still open: Discord vs Slack vs Glue.
- Discord pilot not started (server not created yet).
- Do not paste secrets (Glue client secret, access token, webhook URLs) in Telegram.

## Next
- Pilot Glue Phase 1: incoming webhooks to post daily reports and alerts as threads.
- Decide lane structure for Glue pilot: role-based vs project-based.
- Define Nico end-of-session “handoff” procedure (Letta equivalent) and optionally automate.
