## Completed
- Fixed Letta Code CLI auth — root cause: stale API key (`sk-let-...`) in `.zshrc`, replaced with current OAuth token (`at-let-...`). The CLI uses macOS Keychain via `keytar` but falls back to env var; keychain wasn't working on M1.
- Resolved copy/paste confusion — `Cmd+Shift+V` pastes text into Claude Code, `Cmd+V` doesn't work. Image paste is not supported (terminal limitation).
- Confirmed `/handoff` skill writes session logs to Obsidian `llm-sessions/`

## Decisions
- None — maintenance/troubleshooting session

## Notes / Blockers
- Letta Code `keytar` (macOS Keychain) doesn't reliably work on M1 — env var in `.zshrc` is the working approach
- Image sharing with Claude Code requires saving to file + providing path (no clipboard support)

## Next Session
- Top priority: Phase 0E metadata standards enforcement
- Vincent needs to: Telegram token rotation, rename Slack bot "Slacky", Obsidian Phase 2, 1Password
