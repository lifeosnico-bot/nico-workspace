## Completed
- Background Slack polling built: slack-poll.sh + slack-poll-check.py, polls #vincent-to-nico every 15s
- LaunchAgent com.nico.slack-poller (KeepAlive, RunAtLoad) — survives reboots
- New channel #vincent-to-nico (C0AGM1DR5DK) — dedicated Vincent→Nico channel
- Slacky responds in #vincent-to-nico for two-way chat
- Poller alerts: writes to #alerts + sets statusline indicator (📨 Slack msg)
- context-monitor.sh updated to show Slack alert indicator
- Channel maps updated in slack-post.sh + slack-read.sh
- Significant debugging of LaunchAgent environment (HOME var, python stderr routing)

## Decisions
- #vincent-to-nico replaces #chief-of-staff as the Vincent→Nico channel
- Bot stays in #vincent-to-nico (needed for API reads) but Slacky responds there too
- Poller uses external .py file (not heredoc) — more reliable under LaunchAgent
- LaunchAgent needs HOME env var explicitly set + python stderr to same file as log()

## Notes / Blockers
- Bot display name still "Nico" in Slack — needs rename to "Slacky" (Vincent action in Slack app settings)
- Poller log is chatty (tick/tock every 15s) — needed for LaunchAgent reliability, can reduce later
- Vincent frustrated by iterative debugging — aim for cleaner first-time implementation

## Next Session
- Top priority: Phase 0E metadata standards enforcement
- Vincent needs to: Telegram token rotation, rename bot to Slacky, Obsidian Phase 2, 1Password
