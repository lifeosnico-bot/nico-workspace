## Completed
- Full status.md audit: 13+ stale items marked complete, Active/Queue rewritten
- 31 inbox items triaged: 8 closed as duplicate/done, 23 assigned P1-P5 + V/N owners
- PR #6 merged (nico/session-sync-2026-02-23 → master, all CC-3/4/5 work)
- Peekaboo MCP disabled globally (saves ~9.8k tokens/session)
- `/peekaboo` skill created (toggle on/off, requires session restart)
- `atl` command rule fixed: inbox write only, no execution/decomposition
- Vault `.trash/` configured via `trashOption: local` in app.json
- Telegram bot token rotation moved from Nico queue → Vincent's actions (needs BotFather)
- Session log CC-5 entry added

## Decisions
- Plan mode + todos adopted for all multi-step work
- Peekaboo off by default — re-enable only when GUI automation needed
- `atl` = inbox only (rule added to CLAUDE.md and MEMORY.md)

## Notes / Blockers
- Peekaboo still loads this session (config change needs restart)
- Letta headless writes still blocked (known issue)

## Next Session
- Top priority (Nico): 50% context window alert hook → Phase 0E metadata enforcement
- Top priority (Vincent): Telegram bot token rotation → Slack workspace + bot token → Obsidian Phase 2 → 1Password
