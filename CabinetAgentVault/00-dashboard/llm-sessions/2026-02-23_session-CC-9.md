## Completed
- Slack two-way setup: workspace "Cabinet Agent" (cabinetagent.slack.com)
- 7 channels: #ceo-desk, #status, #alerts, #tasks, #dev, #decisions, #nico-internal
- claude-code-slack-bot: cloned, configured, TS errors fixed, built with Node 22
- LaunchAgent (com.nico.slack-bot) for auto-start on boot
- slack-post.sh: post to any channel by name
- slack-read.sh: read recent messages from any channel
- Alert scripts (context-monitor.sh, permission-alert.sh) now post to Slack #alerts + Telegram
- Auto-default cwd: bot falls back to BASE_DIRECTORY, no manual cwd needed
- Node 25 SDK crash bug filed (#21 on mpociot/claude-code-slack-bot)
- Vincent connected from iPhone — verified two-way comms via #chief-of-staff

## Decisions
- Node 22 pinned for slack-bot (Node 25 crashes SDK CLI — prototype error in bundled cli.js)
- SDK pinned to v1.0.88 (v1.0.35 too old, v2.1.50 ESM-only breaks CJS build)
- bypassPermissions mode for Slack bot (permission MCP server removed — not needed for own machine)
- Main Nico communicates via Slack API (read/post), not through the bot
- Vincent uses #chief-of-staff channel to reach main Nico agent
- Slacky bot (DM-based) is independent — useful but not the primary comms channel

## Notes / Blockers
- Bot display name still "Nico" — should rename to "Slacky" in app manifest
- Background polling not yet built — Nico only reads Slack on-demand currently
- Slack app manifest approach saves massive time vs clicking individual scopes
- simdjson dylib was broken on Node 25 — fixed with brew reinstall

## Next Session
- Top priority: Build background Slack polling (watch #chief-of-staff during sessions)
- Vincent needs to: Telegram bot token rotation, rename bot to Slacky in manifest
