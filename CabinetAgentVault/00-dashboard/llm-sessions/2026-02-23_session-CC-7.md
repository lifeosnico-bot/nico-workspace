## Completed
- Daily note template redesigned — removed Morning Check-in/End of Day checklists, replaced with zero-friction Dump + Nico Processed sections
- Daily note triage protocol added to `~/Nico/CLAUDE.md` Session Protocol — Nico reads and processes Dump at every session start
- Today's daily note created at `00-dashboard/daily/2026-02-23.md`
- `00-dashboard/daily/` directory created

## Decisions
- Daily notes are Vincent's primary laptop capture surface — one Dump section, zero friction
- Nico triages Dump items to status.md inbox, decisions.md, projects, resources, or leaves random thoughts in place
- Three capture surfaces defined: daily note (laptop), Telegram/LettaBot (phone), web clipper (browser)

## Notes / Blockers
- None

## Next Session
- Top priority: Phase 0E metadata standards enforcement
- Vincent needs to: Telegram bot token rotation, Slack workspace, 1Password, Obsidian Phase 2
