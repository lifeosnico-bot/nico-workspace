## Completed
- Deep vault housekeeping — every file audited, no stray docs remaining
- LettaBot Telegram poller conflict investigated and closed (no conflict — single service running correctly)
- Phase 0C MCP context fix verified (no Craft tools loading, GitHub plugin disabled)
- Frontmatter added to 4+ files missing it (task-board, architecture plan, CLI audit, cos-plan archive)
- Malformed filename fixed ("Addedndums" → proper kebab-case)
- decisions.md moved into vault (00-dashboard/), symlinked from Memory/
- session-log.md moved into vault (00-dashboard/), symlinked from Logs/
- Operators manual created in vault (merged guidebook + operators manual)
- Cost audit, guidebook, reconciliation report, setup consolidation — all restored to vault after incorrect trashing
- Duplicate OpenClaw video notes merged (kept full 199-line version)
- .DS_Store files cleaned, vault .trash/ cleared
- 100% frontmatter compliance across all vault content files
- Peekaboo skill inbox items marked done
- Vault consolidation review marked complete (decisions already made in CC-4)

## Decisions
- All operational docs belong in the vault, not loose in Memory/ — vault is the single home for all content
- decisions.md and session-log.md live in vault with symlinks back to their legacy paths

## Notes / Blockers
- None

## Next Session
- Top priority (Nico): Phase 0E metadata standards enforcement
- Vincent needs to: Telegram bot token rotation, Slack workspace + bot token, Obsidian Phase 2, 1Password
