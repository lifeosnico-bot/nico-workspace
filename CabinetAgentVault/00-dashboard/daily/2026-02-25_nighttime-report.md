# Nighttime Report — 2026-02-25

## Overnight Plan
- **What will run:** (not yet wired; manual until Discord/Slack heartbeat is live)
- **What I’m trying to accomplish:** advance agent coordination architecture + Discord pilot setup steps
- **What I will NOT touch:** any secrets, prod systems, or irreversible git actions

## Inputs Needed From Vincent (Blocking)
- Discord server creation confirmation
- 5 channel names (or use defaults)

## Risks / Guardrails
- No bot tokens in chat
- Bot least privilege

## Morning Output Expectation
- **You’ll get:** Morning Report (Telegram + Obsidian)
- **If something breaks:** Telegram message with blocker + next action
