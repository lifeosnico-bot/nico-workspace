## Work Completed (Since Last Report)
- Obsidian: created `05-templates/video-research-note.md`
- Obsidian: created `05-templates/end-of-day-wrapup.md`
- Obsidian: created `05-templates/morning-report.md`
- Video note: `50-clippings/youtube/2026-02-24_multi-agent-team-openclaw-discord_youtube.md`

## In Progress
- Discord pilot planning (bot + bridge)

## Blockers / Risks
- Need Discord server name in text and the 5 starting channel names
- Bot token must be stored locally (no token in chat)

## Today’s Plan (Top 3)
1. Confirm Discord server name + 5 channel names.
2. Walk through Discord Developer Portal bot creation + minimal permissions.
3. Start wiring the Discord bridge on the M1.
