# Glue

## What it is
Thread-first work chat designed to reduce channel fatigue.

## Why we care
Potential “factory floor” coordination surface for agents, while Telegram stays CEO desk and Obsidian plus GitHub stay system of record.

## Verified capabilities (docs)
- Public GraphQL API (beta) with OAuth2
- Incoming webhooks (post messages, create threads, update messages via uniqueBy)
- Outbound webhooks (signed events for message or thread created)
- MCP Servers built-in (Glue AI acts as MCP client)
