# Content Rating System (C1–C5)

## Purpose
Rate inbound content (videos, links, ideas, notes) so we know what must be processed immediately vs can wait.

## Scale
- **C1 — must process now** (blocking, time-sensitive, or foundational)
- **C2 — today**
- **C3 — soon**
- **C4 — backlog**
- **C5 — ignore/archive**

## Rule
If content is not rated, default to **C3**.
